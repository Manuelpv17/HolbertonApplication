      <h1>Self driving cars</h1>
      <p>A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous
      vehicle (AV), connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV), driverless
      car, robo-car, or robotic car, is a vehicle that is
      capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little
	or no human input.</p>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Experiments have been conducted on self-driving cars since at
      least the 1920s; promising trials took place in the 1950s and
      work has proceeded since then. The first self-sufficient and
      truly autonomous cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie
      Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and
      Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's Eureka
      Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies
      and research organizations have developed working autonomous
      vehicles including Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, Continental
      Automotive Systems, Autoliv Inc., Bosch, Nissan, Toyota, Audi,
      Volvo, Vislab from University of Parma, Oxford University and
      Google.In July 2013, Vislab demonstrated BRAiVE, a vehicle that
      moved autonomously on a mixed traffic route open to public
      traffic.  As of 2019, twenty-nine U.S. states have passed laws
      permitting autonomous cars. In Europe, cities in Belgium,
      France, Italy and the UK are planning to operate transport
      systems for driverless cars, and Germany, the Netherlands, and
      Spain have allowed testing robotic cars in traffic. </p>
