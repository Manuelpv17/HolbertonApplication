                         Experiments have been conducted on self-driving cars since at least the 1920s;
                         promising trials took place in the 1950s and work has proceeded since then. The first
                         self-sufficient and truly autonomous cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon
                         University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr
                         University Munich's Eureka Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major
                         companies and research organizations have developed working autonomous vehicles
                         including Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, Continental Automotive Systems, Autoliv
                         Inc., Bosch, Nissan, Toyota, Audi, Volvo, Vislab from University of Parma, Oxford
                         University and Google. In July 2013, Vislab demonstrated BRAiVE, a vehicle that moved
                         autonomously on a mixed traffic route open to public traffic.
                    </p>

                         As of 2019, twenty-nine U.S. states have passed laws permitting autonomous cars. In
                         Europe, cities in Belgium, France, Italy and the UK are planning to operate transport
                         systems for driverless cars, and Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain have allowed
                         testing robotic cars in traffic.

                         In 1925, Houdina Radio Control demonstrated the radio-controlled "American Wonder" on
                         New York City streets, traveling up Broadway and down Fifth Avenue through the thick
                         of the traffic jam. The American Wonder was a 1926 Chandler that was equipped with a
                         transmitting antennae on the tonneau and was operated by a second car that followed
                         it and sent out radio impulses which were caught by the transmitting antennae. The
                         antennae introduced the signals to circuit-breakers which operated small electric
                         motors that directed every movement of the car.

                         Achen Motor, a distributor of cars in Milwaukee and surrounding territory, used
                         Francis' invention under the name "Phantom Auto" and demonstrated it in December 1926
                         on the streets of Milwaukee. It was demonstrated again in June 1932 on the streets of
                         Fredericksburg as a feature attraction of Bigger Bargain Day in which most of the
                         merchants of the city were participating.

                         An early representation of an automated guided car was Norman Bel Geddes's Futurama
                         exhibit sponsored by General Motors at the 1939 World's Fair, which depicted
                         radio-controlled electric cars that were propelled via electromagnetic fields
                         provided by circuits embedded in the roadway.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Bel Geddes later outlined his vision in his book, Magic Motorways (1940), promoting
                         advances in highway design and transportation, foreshadowing the Interstate Highway
                         System, and arguing that humans should be removed from the process of driving. Bel
                         Geddes forecasted these advances to be a reality in 1960.

                         In 1953, RCA Labs successfully built a miniature car that was guided and controlled
                         by wires that were laid in a pattern on a laboratory floor. The system sparked the
                         imagination of Leland M. Hancock, traffic engineer in the Nebraska Department of
                         Roads, and of his director, L. N. Ress, state engineer. The decision was made to
                         experiment with the system in actual highway installations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         In 1957, a full size system was successfully demonstrated by RCA Labs and the State
                         of Nebraska on a 400-foot strip of public highway at the intersection of U.S. Route
                         77 and Nebraska Highway 2, then just outside Lincoln, Nebraska. A series of
                         experimental detector circuits buried in the pavement were a series of lights along
                         the edge of the road. The detector circuits were able to send impulses to guide the
                         car and determine the presence and velocity of any metallic vehicle on its surface. A
                         previous test installation of the system in September 1954 along U.S. Route 73 and
                         U.S. Route 75 in Cass County, Nebraska was utilized as an experimental traffic
                         counter. It was developed in collaboration with General Motors, who paired two
                         standard models with equipment consisting of special radio receivers and audible and
                         visual warning devices that were able to simulate automatic steering, accelerating
                         and brake control.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         It was further demonstrated on 5 June 1960, at RCA Lab's headquarter in Princeton,
                         New Jersey, where reporters were allowed to "drive" on the cars. Commercialization of
                         the system was expected to happen by 1975.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Also during the 1950s throughout the 1960s, General Motors showcased the Firebirds, a
                         series of experimental cars that were described to have an "electronic guide system
                         [that] can rush it over an automatic highway while the driver relaxes".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                         In 1960, Ohio State University's Communication and Control Systems Laboratory
                         launched a project to develop driverless cars which were activated by electronic
                         devices embedded in the roadway. Head of the project, Dr. Robert L. Cosgriff, claimed
                         in 1966 that the system could be ready for installation on a public road in 15 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         In the early 1960s, the Bureau of Public Roads considered the construction of an
                         experimental electronically controlled highway. Four states – Ohio, Massachusetts,
                         New York and California – were bidding for the construction.In August 1961, Popular
                         Science reported on the Aeromobile 35B, an air-cushion vehicle (ACV) that was
                         invented by William Bertelsen and was envisioned to revolutionize the transportation
                         system, with personal self-driving hovering cars that could speed up to 150 Mph.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         During the 1960s, the United Kingdom's Transport and Road Research Laboratory tested
                         a driverless Citroen DS that interacted with magnetic cables that were embedded in
                         the road. It went through a test track at 80 miles per hour (130 km/h) without
                         deviation of speed or direction in any weather conditions, and in a far more
                         effective way than by human control. Research continued in the '70s with cruise
                         control devices activated by signals in the cabling beneath the tracks. According to
                         cost benefit analyses that were made, adoption of system on the British motorways
                         would be repaid by end of the century, increase the road capacity by at least 50% and
                         prevent around 40% of the accidents. Funding for these experiments was withdrawn by
                         the mid-1970s.

                         Also, during the 1960s and the 1970s, Bendix Corporation developed and tested
                         driverless cars that were powered and controlled by buried cables, with wayside
                         communicators relaying computer messages. Stanford demonstrated its Artificial
                         Intelligence Laboratory Cart, a small wheeled robot that once accidentally navigated
                         onto a nearby road.

                         Preliminary research into the intelligent automated logic needed for autonomous cars
                         was conducted at the Coordinated Science Laboratory of the University of Illinois in
                         the early to mid 1970s.

                         In the 1980s, a vision-guided Mercedes-Benz robotic van, designed by Ernst Dickmanns
                         and his team at the Bundeswehr University Munich in Munich, Germany, achieved a speed
                         of 39 miles per hour (63 km/h) on streets without traffic. Subsequently, EUREKA
                         conducted the €749,000,000 Prometheus Project on autonomous vehicles from 1987 to
                         1995.

                    <p>
                         In the same decade, the DARPA-funded Autonomous Land driven Vehicle (ALV) project in
                         the United States made use of new technologies developed by the University of
                         Maryland, Carnegie Mellon University, the Environmental Research Institute of
                         Michigan, Martin Marietta and SRI International. The ALV project achieved the first
                         road-following demonstration that used lidar, computer vision and autonomous robotic
                         control to direct a robotic vehicle at speeds of up to 19 miles per hour (31 km/h).
                         In 1987, HRL Laboratories (formerly Hughes Research Labs) demonstrated the first
                         off-road map and sensor-based autonomous navigation on the ALV. The vehicle traveled
                         over 2,000 feet (610 m) at 1.9 miles per hour (3.1 km/h) on complex terrain with
                         steep slopes, ravines, large rocks, and vegetation. By 1989, Carnegie Mellon
                         University had pioneered the use of neural networks to steer and otherwise control
                         autonomous vehicles, forming the basis of contemporary control strategies.

                         In 1991, the United States Congress passed the ISTEA Transportation Authorization
                         bill, which instructed USDOT to "demonstrate an automated vehicle and highway system
                         by 1997." The Federal Highway Administration took on this task, first with a series
                         of Precursor Systems Analyses and then by establishing the National Automated Highway
                         System Consortium (NAHSC). This cost-shared project was led by FHWA and General
                         Motors, with Caltrans, Delco, Parsons Brinkerhoff, Bechtel, UC-Berkeley, Carnegie
                         Mellon University, and Lockheed Martin as additional partners. Extensive systems
                         engineering work and research culminated in Demo '97 on I-15 in San Diego,
                         California, in which about 20 automated vehicles, including cars, buses, and trucks,
                         were demonstrated to thousands of onlookers, attracting extensive media coverage. The
                         demonstrations involved close-headway platooning intended to operate in segregated
                         traffic, as well as "free agent" vehicles intended to operate in mixed traffic. Other
                         carmakers were invited to demonstrate their systems, such that Toyota and Honda also
                         participated. While the subsequent aim was to produce a system design to aid
                         commercialization, the program was cancelled in the late 1990s due to tightening
                         research budgets at USDOT. Overall funding for the program was in the range of $90
                         million.

                         In 1994, the twin robot vehicles VaMP and Vita-2 of Daimler-Benz and Ernst Dickmanns
                         of UniBwM drove more than 620 miles (1,000 km) on a Paris three-lane highway in
                         standard heavy traffic at speeds up to 81 miles per hour (130 km/h), albeit
                         semi-autonomously with human interventions. They demonstrated autonomous driving in
                         free lanes, convoy driving, and lane changes with autonomous passing of other cars.
                         That same year, Lucas Industries developed parts for a semi-autonomous car in a
                         project that was funded by Jaguar Cars, Lucas, and the UK Department of Trade and
                         Industry.

                         In 1995, Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab project completed a 3,100 miles (5,000
                         km) cross-country journey, of which 98.2% was autonomously controlled, dubbed "No
                         Hands Across America". This car, however, was semi-autonomous by nature: it used
                         neural networks to control the steering wheel, but throttle and brakes were
                         human-controlled, chiefly for safety reasons. Also in 1995, Dickmanns' re-engineered
                         autonomous S-Class Mercedes-Benz undertook a 990 miles (1,590 km) journey from Munich
                         in Bavaria, Germany to Copenhagen, Denmark and back, using saccadic computer vision
                         and transputers to react in real time. The robot achieved speeds exceeding 109 miles
                         per hour (175 km/h) on the German Autobahn, with a mean time between human
                         interventions of 5.6 miles (9.0 km), or 95% autonomous driving. It drove in traffic,
                         executing manoeuvres to pass other cars. Despite being a research system without
                         emphasis on long distance reliability, it drove up to 98 miles (158 km) without human
                         intervention.

                         In 1996, (now Professor) Alberto Broggi of the University of Parma launched the ARGO
                         Project, which worked on enabling a modified Lancia Thema to follow the normal
                         (painted) lane marks in an unmodified highway. The culmination of the project was
                         a journey of 1,200 miles (1,900 km) over six days on the motorways of northern Italy
                         dubbed Mille Miglia in Automatico ("One thousand automatic miles"), with an average
                         speed of 56 miles per hour (90 km/h). The car operated in fully automatic mode for
                         94% of its journey, with the longest automatic stretch being 34 miles (55 km). The
                         vehicle had only two black-and-white low-cost video cameras on board and used
                         stereoscopic vision algorithms to understand its environment.

                         The ParkShuttle, billed as the world's first driverless vehicle,is an automated
                         people mover which uses artificial reference points (magnets) embedded in the road
                         surface to verify its position. Two pilot projects were started in the Netherlands,
                         at Schiphol Airport (December 1997) and business park Rivium (1999). Both carried
                         members of the general public and as such claim stake to the title to the first
                         driverless vehicles. The vehicles are autonomous, do not feature a steering wheel or
                         pedals, nor do they have a safety driver or steward on board. They drive at grade, on
                         a dedicated lane which does feature intersections with pedestrians, bicyclists and
                         cars.

                         The US Government funded three military efforts known as Demo I (US Army), Demo II
                         (DARPA), and Demo III (US Army). Demo III (2001) demonstrated the ability of unmanned
                         ground vehicles to navigate miles of difficult off-road terrain, avoiding obstacles
                         such as rocks and trees. James Albus at the National Institute of Standards and
                         Technology provided the Real-Time Control System which is a hierarchical control
                         system. Not only were individual vehicles controlled (e.g. throttle, steering, and
                         brake), but groups of vehicles had their movements automatically coordinated in
                         response to high level goals.

                         In the first Grand Challenge held in March 2004, DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research
                         Projects Agency) offered a $1 million prize to any team of robotic engineers which
                         could create an autonomous car capable of finishing a 150-mile course in the Mojave
                         Desert. No team was successful in completing the course.

                         In 1998, Willie Jones states that many automakers consider autonomous technology as
                         part of their research yearly. He notes "In May 1998, Toyota became the first to
                         introduce an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system on a production vehicle when it
                         unveiled a laser-based system for its Progres compact luxury sedan, which it sold in
                         Japan".

                         Autonomous vehicles have also been used in mining. In December 2008, Rio Tinto Alcan
                         began testing the Komatsu Autonomous Haulage System – the world's first commercial
                         autonomous mining haulage system – in the Pilbara iron ore mine in Western Australia.
                         Rio Tinto has reported benefits in health, safety, and productivity. In November

                         Audi,
                         Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and Volvo, are in the process of testing driverless car systems. BMW has
                         been
                         testing driverless systems since around 2005, while in 2010, Audi sent a driverless Audi TTS

                         the top of Pike’s Peak at close to race speeds. In 2011, GM created the EN-V (short for
                         Electric
                         Networked Vehicle), an autonomous electric urban vehicle. In 2012, Volkswagen began testing a
                         "Temporary Auto Pilot" (TAP) system that will allow a car to drive itself at speeds of up to 80
